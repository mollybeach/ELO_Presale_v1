# ELO_PreSale_V1

## Staking Feature Roadmap

### Overview

Integrate staking functionality into the existing web3 project to allow users to stake Ethereum and earn rewards.

### Step-by-Step Roadmap

#### 1. Smart Contract Development

- **Objective**: Update existing contracts and implement staking logic.

- **Tasks**:
  - Review `elotoken.sol` and `elotoken_presale.sol` for necessary modifications.
  - Implement staking logic in `elotoken.sol` to manage staked tokens and rewards distribution.
  - Consider using `stakingRewards.sol` or similar pattern for rewarding stakers.

#### 2. Backend Integration

- **Objective**: Update Node.js backend to support staking operations.

- **Tasks**:
  - Add API endpoints for staking operations (deposit, withdraw, claim rewards).
  - Update database schema if necessary to store staking-related data.

#### 3. Frontend Development

- **Objective**: Create user interfaces for staking operations and integrate with smart contracts.

- **Tasks**:
  - Develop React components (e.g., StakeForm, StakingDashboard) for staking operations.
  - Integrate with Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with smart contracts.
  - Display staking information and rewards in user dashboard (Stake.jsx, StakingGuide.jsx).

#### 4. Testing

- **Objective**: Ensure the staking feature works correctly across all layers.

- **Tasks**:
  - Write unit tests for smart contracts (`elotoken.sol`) to validate staking logic.
  - Test API endpoints and frontend components for staking functionality.

#### 5. Deployment and Security

- **Objective**: Prepare for deployment on testnet and mainnet while ensuring security.

- **Tasks**:
  - Deploy updated smart contracts to testnet (e.g., Ropsten) for initial testing.
  - Conduct security audits or use tools like MythX to identify vulnerabilities.
  - Optimize gas usage and implement security measures for mainnet deployment.

#### 6. User Documentation and Support

- **Objective**: Provide comprehensive documentation and support for users.

- **Tasks**:
  - Update project README.md with staking feature details, contract addresses, and frontend instructions.
  - Create user guides on how to stake tokens, view rewards, and withdraw funds.

#### 7. Maintenance and Future Enhancements

- **Objective**: Ensure ongoing support and plan for future improvements.

- **Tasks**:
  - Monitor smart contract performance and security post-deployment.
  - Gather user feedback to iterate on UI/UX improvements for staking features.
  - Plan for future enhancements such as governance features or additional staking pools.
